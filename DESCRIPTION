Description: The AlzTrial package provides a straightforward tool to plan the sample size and budget for a two-endpoint clinical trial, modeled after a hypothetical Alzheimerâ€™s disease study. Given specific effect sizes, standard deviations, and costs, the plan_alz_trial() function calculates the required number of participants and the total estimated cost, adhering to pre-set statistical power and error rates.
