}
\arguments{
\item{delta_cdr}{The clinically meaningful difference to detect for the CDR-Sum of Boxes endpoint.}

\item{sd_cdr}{The standard deviation for the CDR-Sum of Boxes endpoint.}

\item{delta_hv}{The clinically meaningful difference to detect for the hippocampal volume endpoint (percent change).}

\item{sd_hv}{The standard deviation for the hippocampal volume endpoint.}

\item{cost_baseline}{The cost in USD for the baseline visit per participant.}

\item{cost_followup}{The cost in USD for the follow-up visit per participant.}

\item{cost_mri_per_scan}{The cost in USD for a single MRI scan.}

\item{power}{The desired statistical power, typically 0.80 or 0.90. Defaults to 0.90.}

\item{fwer}{The desired family-wise error rate, typically 0.05. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{num_endpoints}{The number of primary/secondary endpoints being tested. Used for Bonferroni correction. Defaults to 2.}
}
\value{
A nested list containing three main elements:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{inputs}: A list of the core statistical parameters used in the calculation.
  \item \strong{sample_size}: A list detailing the required N for each endpoint, the final total enrollment, and the MRI substudy size.
  \item \strong{cost_breakdown}: A list detailing the total clinical, MRI, and overall trial costs.
